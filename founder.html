        <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
        <p>Lindsay Jenkins, the founder of Speak with Strength, has dedicated over 20 years to educating students in mathematics. Originally from Sumter, SC, she is a passionate educator, mother, and advocate for youth development. Inspired by the challenges her son, Johnathan Jenkins, faced when entering college—particularly with public speaking and interviewing—Lindsay recognized a greater need in her middle school students and nephews. That inspired her to build a movement focused on empowering youth through communication skills and confidence.</p>
